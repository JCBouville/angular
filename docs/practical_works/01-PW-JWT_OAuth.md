# PW - JWT Authentication

1- In app/src/services/auth/auth-jwt.service.ts, implement the "authenticateSuccess" function by following the comments
2- Implement HttpInterceptor "app/src/services/auth/auth-jwt.interceptor.ts" in order to send the JWT via the Authorization request header
3- Make sure that the JWT controler filter is active - See /bookstore/src/main/java/com/worldline/bookstore/config/SecurityConfiguration.java
4- Test the JWT authentication : http://localhost:4200/#/login - Check that the JWT is stored in client storage
