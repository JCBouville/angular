PW - Third party components with known vulnerabilities

1 - Load a js script from Content Delivery Network (CDN) with SRI
    a) In index.html, load the minified version 3.2.1 of "jquery" from "cdnjs.cloudflare.com" (take care of the version number)  
    b) Implement sub resource integrity (SRI) to check the resource integrity
    
    Hints :
      - Get resources with SRI from https://cdnjs.com or use the online tool https://www.srihash.org/ to generate SRI hash
      - if CSP is configured, you will have to update it in order to allow external resources from CDN 
        (add appropriate hash in 'script-src' directive - work only for Chrome) 
      
2 - Detect known vulnerable third party components
    a) Detect known vulnerable JavaScript libraries
    b) Detect known vulnerable maven dependencies
    
    Hints : 
      - npm install and execute "retire" in root folder
      - Install and launch maven plugin "MavenDependencyCheck" under "bookstore" folder
