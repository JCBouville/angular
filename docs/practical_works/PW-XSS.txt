PW - XSS


1 - Render HTML formatting elements in Angular
    a) in "Home" page, create a "news" with formatted content by using HTML elements like <b> and <i> . Add links. 
       Hint : Use "[innerHTML]" attribute to render safe HTML tags
       
    b) create a "news" with scripting. What do you observe ? Take a look at the console.
      
2 - Use DomSanitizer service 
    a) to transform the "Welcome" message (see "Home" page) to a classical link which displays an alert popup (use "javascript:alert" syntax).
    b) [Just for the demo, don't do this in a real situation] to sanitize the "newsOfTheDay" content in order to execute some basic and safe scripting based on DOM even listener (onclick, ...)
